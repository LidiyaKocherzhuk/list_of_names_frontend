Overview
1. Create a program in any programming language you are comfortable with that keeps track of an ordered, numbered list of names.
2. We should have users, but the list is one for all users. Meanwhile, each user should have their own order.
3. Each name should have a rank (numbered) associated with it and be displayed in the program.
4. The list should be sorted ascending based on rank.
5. You should be able to re-order the list, moving a name up or down the list to change its associated rank. This can be with drop-downs or drag-and-drop or any method of your choosing, as long as it works.
6. You should be able to add to and delete from the list.
7. You should be able to edit an item in the list.
